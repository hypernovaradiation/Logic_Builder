# #️⃣Logic Builder#️⃣

This repository is for those who seek to excel at programming logic and are willing to spend time on practicing problems daily.

The problems are divided into three sections: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced

-> <b>[BASIC](/Basic/INDEX.md)</b> section contains the most basic problems like <u>hello world or add two numbers</u> and any beginner can easily study from these problems and can even contribute in this section. 

-> <b>[INTERMEDIATE](/Basic/INDEX.md)</b> section contains problems like <u>pattern printing, recursion, string operations or maybe file handling etc.</u> Programmers with basic knowledge of any programming language can practice the questions given in this section and may contribute in it.

-> <b>[ADVANCED](/Basic/INDEX.md)</b> section contains some of the most famous problems for logic building like <u>N-queens problem or an automatic sudoku solver.</u> This is also the section where geeks-for-geeks problem of the day or problems from codechef can be uploaded. Contributing in this section is highly appreciated.

All sections contain a `INDEX.md` file where many practice questions are listed. If the solution is already present in the repository then the question ends with a [Language: \<Language_Name\>  Author: \<Author_Name\>] tag, else it ends without any tag.<br>
Language_Name is the programming language in which the question has already been solved.

You can be the first one to solve the questions without any tag. To know more about contributing guidlines, check [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
