# #️⃣Logic Builder#️⃣

This repository is for those who seek to excel at programming logic and are willing to spend time on practicing problems daily.

The problems are divided into three sections: Basic, Intermediate and Advanced

-> <b>BASIC</b> section contains the most basic problems like <u>hello world or add two numbers</u> and any beginner can easily study from these problems and can even contribute in this section. 

-> <b>INTERMEDIATE</b> section contains problems like <u>pattern printing, recursion, string operations or maybe file handling etc.</u> Programmers with basic knowledge of any programming language can practice the questions given in this section and may contribute in it.

-> <b>ADVANCED</b> section contains some of the most famous problems for logic building like <u>N-queens problem or an automatic sudoku solver.</u> This is also the section where geeks-for-geeks problem of the day or problems from codechef can be uploaded. Contributing in this section is highly appreciated.

All sections contain a `problems.md` file where many practice questions are listed. If the solution is already present in the repository then the question starts with a [solved: language1, language2,...] tag, else, it starts with an [issue] tag.<br>
language1, language2, etc. are the programming languages in which the questions has already been solved.

You can be the first one to solve the questions with the [issue] tag. To know more about contributing, check `contributing.md` file.
